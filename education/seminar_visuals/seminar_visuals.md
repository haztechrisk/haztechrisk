- *Reliability, Risk, and High-Stakes Wagering* : Seminar explained engineering design as an exercise in decision making. Here, engineers must synthesize design alternatives that have future operational peformance/behaviors that cannot be predicted with certainty.  They must then select the alternative having the most preferred *risk*.  Thus, engineering design can be framed withing the economic analytics of risk appetites and value at risk where one stakes a bet on a design alternative having the most preferred risk-encumbered operational outcome.
- *A Critical Look at PRA*:  Seminar explains the consequences of assumptions underlying *Probabilistic Risk Analysis* (PRA), showing that PRA necessarily leads to an optimistic bias when attemptin to quantify the probability of a catastrophic event in hazardous production operations.
